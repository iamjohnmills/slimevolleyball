# About
This is my contribution to the Slime Volleyball community. I wasted many hours of my life playing the original, and thought I'd waste some more making this.

I set out to create a version of Slime Volleyball in native javascript that was as close the original as possible.

I used object oriented principles to abstract and refactor everything from my starting point and inspiration: Jonathan Marler's version of Slime Volleyball. I integrated the online version using Node, Express and Socket.io.

# More
I abstracted a SlimeAI class to make it easier to integrate new opponent boss fights. I hope to integrate the rest of the gang over time, and create new ones like the Big Blue boss and psycho slime.

The speed of online play is currently a little janky and could probably be optimized. I have no idea what happens if the server gets overloaded with users
